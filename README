Sharefix addresses the pain point of your quickfix list being wiped out
between running different commands or functions that update the list.

For example, you run your unit tests and get a list of tests that
failed. Then when you make some changes, write the file, and your linter
auto command kicks off and clears the list of tests. Now to fix the
other failed tests you have to rerun all your tests.

Sharefix lets you easily make your quickfix commands or functions play
nicely together and share the list with each other.
